# AI-Enhanced Development Environment Setup

This guide outlines recommended steps to prepare a GitHub repository for collaboration with multiple AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Copilot Chat/Agents, OpenAI Codex, and Google Gemini Code Assist) using either GitHub Codespaces or a local development environment.

## 1. Establish a Template Repository

1. Create a new repository that will act as the canonical template for future projects.
2. Populate the template with:
   - Standard issue and pull request templates.
   - Base GitHub Actions workflows (continuous integration, linting, dependency scanning, deployment).
   - Repository metadata (labels, milestones, project boards) stored as `.yml` or `.json` configuration files under `.github/` where possible.
3. Enable "Template repository" in the repository settings so new repos can inherit the structure.

## 2. Configure Repository Settings

| Area | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| **Branches** | Protect `main`/`release` branches with required reviews, status checks, and signed commits if applicable. |
| **Secrets** | Store API keys for AI services (Copilot, OpenAI, Google) in GitHub Secrets for CI/CD use. |
| **Access** | Grant collaborators least-privilege access; use GitHub Teams for role-based permissions. |
| **Security** | Enable Dependabot alerts and automated security updates. |

## 3. Standardize Issue & PR Automation

- Use `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` to define bug/feature/discussion templates aligned with triage automation.
- Configure `.github/pull_request_template.md` to require testing evidence and AI usage notes.
- Define a label taxonomy in `.github/labels.yml` (if using `github-label-sync`) or manage via GitHub UI.
- Set up milestones that mirror project roadmap phases.
- Connect repository to a GitHub Project (beta) with fields for status, priority, and owner. Automate card creation via Actions or the Project workflows UI.

## 4. Workflow Integrations

1. **Continuous Integration**
   - Create reusable workflows (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) that lint, test, and build.
   - Use matrix strategies to cover key runtimes.
2. **AI Quality Gates**
   - Add optional jobs that surface Copilot/Codex suggestions (e.g., `copilot-cli assess`) and static analysis (CodeQL).
   - Integrate policy checks ensuring AI-generated code is reviewed and attributed.
3. **Automation Bots**
   - Configure GitHub Apps like `release-drafter`, `auto-merge`, and `triage` for predictable automation.

## 5. Codespaces & Local Environment

### Codespaces

- Define `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` with:
  - Extensions for Copilot, Copilot Chat, and Gemini Code Assist (if available via VS Code marketplace).
  - Post-create commands to install `copilot` CLI, `gh` CLI, and any SDKs (OpenAI, Google).
  - Port forwarding defaults and container resources sized for AI tooling (4+ cores, 8+ GB RAM recommended).
- Store reusable devcontainer features for consistent linting/testing tools.

### Local Development

- Mirror the devcontainer config using VS Code's `devcontainer` extension or `docker-compose`.
- Maintain `.tool-versions` or `.nvmrc` to lock runtimes for parity with CI.
- Provide setup scripts (e.g., `scripts/setup-ai-tools.sh`) that install CLIs/SDKs and configure environment variables.

## 6. Credential & Policy Management

- Document environment variables required for each AI tool in `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md` and provide sample `.env.example` files.
- Use secret scanning to ensure credentials are not committed.
- Establish usage policies covering:
  - Attribution for AI-generated code.
  - Required human review before merge.
  - Compliance with licensing or data-handling rules.

## 7. Onboarding Checklist

Create a checklist issue template for new contributors including:

- Enable Copilot, Copilot Chat, Codex, and Gemini extensions in their editor.
- Authenticate `gh` CLI and `copilot` CLI.
- Run `npm install`/`pip install`/etc. in Codespaces or locally.
- Execute lint/test workflows locally to validate tooling.

## 8. Continuous Improvement

- Schedule quarterly reviews of automation effectiveness, AI tool usage metrics, and workflow run times.
- Encourage contributors to log AI feedback in a dedicated GitHub Discussion or Project view.
- Iterate on templates and workflows as best practices evolve.

---

With this foundation in place, you can create new repositories from the template and immediately benefit from consistent automation, governance, and AI-assisted development workflows.

## Appendix: Using "Copy patch" and "Copy git apply" in GitHub Diffs

When reviewing pull requests in the GitHub web UI you will often see two handy buttons above each diff hunk: **Copy patch** and **Copy git apply**. These shortcuts let you quickly bring suggested changes into your local environment without manually editing files.

### Copy patch

- **What it copies:** A standard unified diff (the same text that would appear if you clicked the "Raw" view of the diff).
- **How to use it:**
  1. Click **Copy patch** on the desired diff hunk.
  2. Paste the contents into a file (for example `snippet.patch`).
  3. Apply it locally with `git apply snippet.patch` or inspect it with tools like `patch`.
- **When to use it:** Choose this when you simply want the diff text and prefer to manage the `git apply` step manually or share the diff with someone else.

### Copy git apply

- **What it copies:** A ready-to-run shell command that echoes the diff and immediately pipes it into `git apply`.
- **How to use it:**
  1. Click **Copy git apply** to copy the command to your clipboard.
  2. Paste the command directly into your terminal while you are inside the repository.
  3. Run it to apply the diff in one stepâ€”no temporary files required.
- **When to use it:** This is ideal for quickly applying small suggested changes or reviewer patches during code review, especially when you trust the diff and want a streamlined workflow.

Both options produce identical results once applied; the difference is simply whether you receive the raw diff or a turnkey command. After applying either version, remember to verify the changes (`git diff`, run tests) before committing.
