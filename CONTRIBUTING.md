## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/scotlaclair.github.io.git
   cd scotlaclair.github.io
   ```
3. **Add the upstream repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/scotlaclair/scotlaclair.github.io.git
   ```
4. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## The Spark Process

This repository uses a "Spark" system for managing ideas and innovation:

1. **Submit a Spark** - Use the Spark issue template to propose new ideas
2. **Triage** - Sparks are reviewed and categorized (within 5 business days)
3. **Discussion** - Community discusses the spark's viability and approach
4. **Decision** - Spark is approved, needs more info, or closed
5. **Promotion** - Approved sparks become features or projects
6. **Implementation** - Work begins through issues and pull requests

### When to Use a Spark

- You have a new idea or concept to explore
- You're proposing a significant new feature
- You want to discuss a potential direction before implementation
- You've identified an opportunity for improvement

### When to Use Other Issue Types

- **Bug Report** - For existing functionality that isn't working correctly
- **Feature Request** - For well-defined features ready for implementation
- **Documentation** - For documentation improvements
- **Setup Issues** - For repository configuration tasks (items 1-7)

### Detailed Spark Documentation

For comprehensive information about the Spark process, see:
- üìñ [Spark Process Documentation](.github/SPARK_PROCESS.md) - Detailed guide on submitting, reviewing, and promoting sparks
- üîÑ [Spark Workflow Guide](.github/SPARK_WORKFLOW.md) - Visual workflow diagrams and examples
- üí° [Submit a Spark](../../issues/new?template=spark.yml) - Start the process!

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- üí° **Sparks** - New ideas and concepts
- üêõ **Bug Fixes** - Fixing issues and problems
- ‚ú® **Features** - Implementing new functionality
- üìö **Documentation** - Improving docs, guides, and examples
- üß™ **Tests** - Adding or improving tests
- üé® **Design** - UI/UX improvements
- üîß **Maintenance** - Refactoring, dependencies, infrastructure

### Contribution Process

1. **Check existing issues** - See if your contribution is already being discussed
2. **Open an issue first** - Discuss significant changes before starting work
3. **Get assignment** - Wait for issue assignment or approval before starting
4. **Do the work** - Make your changes following our guidelines
5. **Submit a PR** - Create a pull request with your changes
6. **Address feedback** - Work with maintainers to refine your contribution
7. **Merge** - Once approved, your contribution will be merged!

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We use the following branch naming conventions:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `feature/*` - New features (e.g., `feature/add-search`)
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/fix-navigation`)
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)
- `spark/*` - Experimental spark implementations (e.g., `spark/idea-xyz`)

### Making Changes

1. **Keep changes focused** - One feature/fix per PR
2. **Write clear commit messages** - Use the format: `type: description`
   - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
   - Example: `feat: add search functionality to homepage`
3. **Test your changes** - Ensure everything works as expected
4. **Update documentation** - Keep docs in sync with code changes

### Testing

Since this is primarily a static site:

1. **Local Testing** - Open HTML files in a browser
2. **Link Checking** - Verify all links work correctly
3. **Responsive Testing** - Check on different screen sizes
4. **Cross-browser Testing** - Test in multiple browsers when possible

## Issue Guidelines

### Creating Issues

- **Use templates** - Choose the appropriate issue template
- **Be specific** - Provide clear, detailed information
- **One issue per topic** - Don't combine multiple unrelated issues
- **Search first** - Check if the issue already exists

### Issue Labels

We use labels to organize and prioritize work:

- `spark` - New ideas and concepts
- `triage` - Needs review and categorization
- `feature` - New feature requests
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `enhancement` - Improvements to existing features
- `good-first-issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help-wanted` - Extra attention needed
- `in-progress` - Currently being worked on
- `blocked` - Waiting on something else

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Update your branch** with the latest changes from `main`:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```
2. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure your changes work as expected
3. **Review your own code** - Check for issues before submission
4. **Update documentation** - If your changes affect usage

### Submitting a PR

1. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Create a Pull Request** from your fork to the main repository
3. **Fill out the PR template** completely
4. **Link related issues** using keywords like "Closes #123"
5. **Request review** from maintainers

### PR Requirements

- [ ] Clear description of changes
- [ ] All links and references work correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
