### Configuring Categories

1. Go to **Discussions** tab
2. Click the **‚öôÔ∏è gear icon** or **"Categories"**
3. Click **"New category"** to add custom categories
4. For each category:
   - Set a name and emoji
   - Choose the format (Discussion, Q&A, Announcement, Poll)
   - Add a description
   - Optionally set a template (reference templates in .github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/)

## Discussion Templates

Templates help users create well-structured discussions. We've included three templates:

### Available Templates

1. **ideas.yml** - For sharing and discussing ideas
2. **questions.yml** - For asking questions
3. **show-and-tell.yml** - For showcasing work

### How Templates Work

When users create a discussion in a category with a template:
1. They see a form with structured fields
2. They fill out the relevant information
3. The discussion is created with proper formatting
4. Labels are automatically applied

## Examples of Great Discussions

### Good Question Example
```
Title: How do I add a custom 404 page?

I want to add a custom error page for when visitors land on a broken link.
I saw it mentioned in the README as an optional addition.

What I've tried:
- Creating 404.html in the root
- Not sure if I need to configure anything else

Can someone guide me through the process?
```

### Good Idea Example
```
Title: Add a search feature to the documentation

I've been thinking it would be great to add a search box to the docs/index.html
page so visitors can quickly find what they're looking for.

Potential approaches:
1. Client-side search using JavaScript
2. Integration with GitHub search
3. Third-party service like Algolia

Thoughts? Is this something we'd want to pursue?
```

### Good Show & Tell Example
```
Title: Created a dark mode toggle for the site

I added a dark mode feature to my fork and wanted to share!

Features:
- Toggle button in the header
- Remembers preference in localStorage
- Smooth transitions between modes

Demo: [link]
Code: [link to fork]

Would love feedback or to contribute this back if there's interest!
```
