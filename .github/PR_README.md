# PR Documentation: Issue #11 Sub-Issue Management

This document provides an overview of the work completed in this PR to address Issue #11 and establish proper sub-issue management practices.

## Problem

**Original Issue:** Issue #11 - "Future Enhancements and Manual Testing for Spark Automation"

**What Went Wrong:**
- PR #12 was created to address Issue #11
- PR #12 only completed one section (Manual Testing Documentation)
- PR #12 incorrectly used `Fixes #11` which auto-closed the entire issue
- Issue #11 had another section (Future Enhancements) that still needed work
- Issue #11 was manually reopened, creating confusion

**Root Cause:**
- No clear documentation on when to use `Closes` vs `Part of` vs `Relates to`
- Lack of guidance on managing parent issues with sub-tasks
- No process for breaking large issues into manageable sub-issues

## Solution

This PR provides comprehensive documentation and guidance to prevent this issue from happening again and to properly complete Issue #11.
