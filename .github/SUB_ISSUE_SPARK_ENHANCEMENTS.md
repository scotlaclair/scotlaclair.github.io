## Issue Title
`[Sparks]: Future Enhancements and Manual Testing for Spark Automation`

## Issue Labels
- `spark`
- `enhancement`
- `testing`
- `automation`

## Issue Description

### Overview

This sub-issue tracks potential improvements to the Spark System automation (implemented in PR #10) and outlines the manual testing requirements to validate the automation works as expected in production.

### Related Work

- **Parent Issue:** #9 - Address Spark System Completion Review and Checklist Automation
- **Implementation PR:** #10 - Fix workflow comment indentation and implement automated checklist updates
- **Source:** Extracted from `.github/CHECKLIST_AUTOMATION_SUMMARY.md`

## Future Enhancements

The following improvements could enhance the Spark System automation:

### 1. Checklist in Comments
**Description:** Support updating checklist items in comments, not just issue descriptions

**Current Limitation:** 
- Automation only updates checklists in issue descriptions
- Many users organize work with checklists in comments

**Potential Approach:**
- Scan issue comments for checklist patterns
- Update comments via API when PRs merge
- Handle comment edit permissions and notifications

**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** Medium-High (requires comment scanning and edit logic)

### 2. NLP Matching
**Description:** More sophisticated text matching using Natural Language Processing

**Current Limitation:**
- Keyword matching requires 2+ significant word overlaps
- May miss semantically similar items with different wording

**Potential Approach:**
- Integrate NLP library (e.g., natural, compromise)
- Use semantic similarity scoring
- Match based on meaning, not just keywords

**Priority:** Low (current matching works reasonably well)
**Complexity:** High (requires NLP expertise)

### 3. Configurable Threshold
**Description:** Allow tuning of keyword match sensitivity

**Current Limitation:**
- Hard-coded 2+ word match threshold
- No way to adjust for different project needs

**Potential Approach:**
- Add configuration file (e.g., `.github/spark-config.yml`)
- Allow per-repo or per-issue threshold settings
- Provide sensible defaults

**Priority:** Low-Medium
**Complexity:** Low (simple configuration addition)

### 4. Batch Updates
**Description:** Handle multiple checklist items per PR better

**Current Limitation:**
- First matching item gets checked
- Doesn't handle PRs that complete multiple tasks

**Potential Approach:**
- Match PR against all checklist items
- Check all matching items
- Provide summary of what was updated

**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** Medium (requires logic changes)

### 5. Project Integration
**Description:** Auto-update GitHub Projects boards

**Current Limitation:**
- Only updates issue checklists
- GitHub Projects board status requires manual updates

**Potential Approach:**
- Integrate with GitHub Projects API v2
- Update card status when checklist items complete
- Move cards across columns based on progress

**Priority:** High (popular feature request)
**Complexity:** High (Projects API is complex)

### 6. Metrics Dashboard
**Description:** Track automation success rates

**Current Limitation:**
- No visibility into automation performance
- Hard to identify patterns of failure

**Potential Approach:**
- Store workflow run data
- Generate weekly/monthly reports
- Create dashboard with key metrics:
  - Match rate (successful vs. failed)
  - Average update time
  - Most common failure reasons

**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** Medium-High (requires data collection and visualization)

### 7. Undo Support
**Description:** Ability to revert incorrect auto-updates

**Current Limitation:**
- No way to undo if automation checks wrong item
- Requires manual edit to fix

**Potential Approach:**
- Add command in comments: `/undo-checklist #PR`
- Track what was changed in metadata
- Provide undo workflow

**Priority:** Low-Medium
**Complexity:** Medium (requires change tracking)

## Manual Testing Requirements

The following manual tests must be performed to validate the Spark System automation in production. See `.github/TESTING_SPARK_AUTOMATION.md` for detailed procedures.

### Test Suite 1: Basic Spark Workflow

#### Test 1.1: Spark Submission and Welcome Comment
**Purpose:** Verify new sparks receive automatic labels and welcome comment

**Steps:**
1. Create new Spark issue using template
2. Verify `spark`, `triage`, and `stage-ideation` labels applied
3. Verify welcome comment appears within 1-2 minutes

**Status:** ⏳ Pending
**Assigned:** TBD
**Deadline:** Before v1.0 release

#### Test 1.2: Spark Promotion Notification
**Purpose:** Verify promoted sparks receive notification comment

**Steps:**
1. Add `promoted` or `stage-development` label to test spark
2. Verify promotion comment appears

**Status:** ⏳ Pending
**Assigned:** TBD
**Deadline:** Before v1.0 release

#### Test 1.3: Title-Based Auto-Labeling
**Purpose:** Verify issues/PRs receive labels based on title keywords

**Steps:**
1. Create issues with various title patterns
2. Verify appropriate labels applied automatically

**Status:** ⏳ Pending
**Assigned:** TBD
**Deadline:** Before v1.0 release

### Test Suite 2: Checklist Automation

#### Test 2.1: Direct PR Number Reference
**Purpose:** Verify checklist updates when PR number is in checklist item

**Setup:**
- Parent issue with checklist: `- [ ] Fix bug (PR #123)`

**Steps:**
1. Create PR #123 that links to parent issue
